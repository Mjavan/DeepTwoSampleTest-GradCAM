Training: 

exp1: 50 epochs, 30'th epoch, latent_dim=10

exp2: 50 epochs, 50'th epoch, latent_dim=10


Inference:

exp1



Imapges:

 recosntrsuctions => results 
 
#### Details about Experiments

Training: In training, I set norm=false, because I could not visualaize the heatmaps
Inference: In inference, I also set norm=False

Testset: In testset, I chose two classes for heatmap generation. Half of them belongs to one class,
the other half belongs to other class

#### Details about experiments that I visualised the heatmaps

for exp4 I backprobagated test-statistic on to the group X


#### Details about codes that I wrote:
dataset:
    dataloader2.py => I took, train, val and test set from here

Heatmap generation: 
    gradcam1.py => here I used both (abs) and (relu) function applied on linear combination of activation maps
    
Inference on Test set:
    Visualise_Two_Sample_Test2.py => Here I applied trained vae on test-set (main code) implimenting Grad-CAM by myself 
    
    Visualise_Two_Sample_Test.py => Here I used captum library that didn't work
    
Overlaying heatmaps on Images:

    Overlay_Heatmap.py 
    
Statistical Test and Clustering:
    
    StatisticalTest.py => Here, I perform different statistical tests including DeepTwoSampleTest
    
    embeddingtest.py => MMDTest from Matthias


#### List of directories to save images and heatmaps

svd_dir_heatmap = root_dir / 'Explainability' / 'Codes' / 'Two_Test' / 'heatmaps'
svd_dir_image = root_dir / 'Explainability' / 'Codes' / 'Two_Test' / 'images'
svd_dir_overlay = root_dir / 'Explainability' / 'Codes' / 'Two_Test' / 'overlays'
